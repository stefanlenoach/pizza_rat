## üìù Notes
- Yes, Google Places API can be used to find all local pizza restaurants! The Places API allows you to search for places by type (like "restaurant" or more specifically "pizza"), within a specified radius from a location.
- For best performance, we might want to cache some pizza place data locally rather than hitting the Google API for every request.
- Consider implementing a moderation system for reviews to prevent spam or inappropriate content.
